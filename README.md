# People_Counting_and_Tracking_System
The objective of this project is to develop a people counter device to count the number of pedestrians walking through a door or corridor through a video or camera. Most of the time, this system is used at the entrance of a building so that the total number of visitors can be recorded. Live stream of visitorâ€™s flow is streamed on to a web application.
